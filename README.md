 Bank Loan Report Analysis | SQL â€¢ Power Query â€¢ DAX â€¢ Power BI
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes bank loan data to monitor loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and borrower risk.
The objective was to build a 3-page interactive dashboard (Summary, Overview, Details) to provide insights into portfolio health and borrower trends.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Banks face challenges in tracking loan applications, repayments, and borrower risk across multiple dimensions such as time, region, loan type, employment length, and home ownership.
This project helps solve that problem by:

Calculating KPIs: Total Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. DTI.

Comparing Good vs Bad Loans to assess portfolio health.

Building dashboards to analyze monthly, regional, and borrower-level patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Process & Tools Used

Excel â†’ Data source

Power Query â†’ Data cleaning & transformation

SQL â†’ KPI calculations (Applications, Funded Amount, Repayments, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. DTI, Good vs Bad Loans)

Power BI (DAX) â†’ Data modeling & validation of results

Power BI Dashboards â†’ Built 3 interactive dashboards:

Summary Dashboard â†’ KPIs & Good vs Bad Loan distribution

Overview Dashboard â†’ Monthly, Regional, Term, Employment, Purpose, Ownership analysis

Details Dashboard â†’ Loan-level insights (purpose, grade, funded amount, installments, repayments)

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights

$435.8M funded vs $473.1M received
